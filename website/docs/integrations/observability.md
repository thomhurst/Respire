# Observability

Respire emits OpenTelemetry-compatible activities and metrics from sources named `Respire`.

## Traces and metrics

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing.AddSource("Respire"))
    .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics.AddMeter("Respire"));
```

Instrumentation follows OpenTelemetry database semantic conventions. `db.namespace` reports the configured Redis database index.

Raw command values are not attached to spans because arbitrary Redis payloads cannot be reliably sanitized. Pipelines and transactions are recorded as single operations.

## Latency

Operation latency uses the stable `db.client.operation.duration` histogram and records seconds, as required by the semantic convention.

## Logging

Pass an `ILoggerFactory` through `RespireOptions` or use the dependency-injection integration. Logs cover connection lifecycle and recovery without logging command payloads.

## Health state

For health checks or dashboards, combine `IsConnected` with `ConnectionStateChanged`:

```csharp
redis.ConnectionStateChanged += state =>
    healthState.Update(state);
```

A transient reconnection is expected to move through connection states; use application-level thresholds before paging an operator.
